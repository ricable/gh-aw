# Dependabot Burner

- Only create project views if they don't exist.
- Identify all open Dependabot pull requests.
- Group them by runtime and manifest file.
- Create a parent issue for each group, bundling the related PRs.
- Add each parent issue to the project board.
- Remove the individual PRs from the board once bundled.
- Assign each parent issue to Copilot.
