# Dictation Instructions

## Technical Context

GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw) is a CLI tool for writing agentic workflows in natural language using markdown files and running them as GitHub Actions. When fixing dictated text, use these project-specific terms and conventions, and improve text clarity by removing filler words and making it more professional.

## Fix Speech-to-Text Errors

Common speech-to-text misrecognitions and their corrections:

### Safe Outputs/Inputs
- "safe output" → safe-output
- "safe outputs" → safe-outputs
- "safe input" → safe-input
- "safe inputs" → safe-inputs
- "save outputs" → safe-outputs
- "save output" → safe-output

### Workflow Terms
- "agent ic workflows" → agentic workflows
- "agent tick workflows" → agentic workflows
- "work flow" → workflow
- "work flows" → workflows
- "G H A W" → gh-aw
- "G age A W" → gh-aw

### Configuration
- "front matter" → frontmatter
- "tool set" → toolset
- "tool sets" → toolsets
- "M C P servers" → MCP servers
- "M C P server" → MCP server
- "lock file" → lockfile

### Commands & Operations
- "re compile" → recompile
- "runs on" → runs-on
- "time out minutes" → timeout-minutes
- "work flow dispatch" → workflow-dispatch
- "pull request" → pull-request (in YAML contexts)

### GitHub Actions
- "add comment" → add-comment
- "add labels" → add-labels
- "close issue" → close-issue
- "create issue" → create-issue
- "pull request review" → pull-request-review

### AI Engines & Bots
- "co-pilot" → copilot (when referring to the engine)
- "Co-Pilot" → Copilot
- "at copilot" → @copilot (when assigning/mentioning the bot)
- "@ copilot" → @copilot
- "copilot" → @copilot (when context indicates assignment or mention)
- "code X" → codex
- "Code X" → Codex

### Spacing/Hyphenation Ambiguity
When context suggests a GitHub Actions key or CLI flag:
- Use hyphens: `timeout-minutes`, `runs-on`, `cache-memory`
- In YAML: prefer hyphenated form
- In prose: either form acceptable, prefer hyphenated for consistency

## Clean Up and Improve Text

Make dictated text clearer and more professional by:

### Remove Filler Words
Common filler words and verbal tics to remove:
- "humm", "hmm", "hm"
- "um", "uh", "uhh", "er", "err"
- "you know"
- "like" (when used as filler, not for comparisons)
- "basically", "actually", "essentially" (when redundant)
- "sort of", "kind of" (when used to hedge unnecessarily)
- "I mean", "I think", "I guess"
- "right?", "yeah", "okay" (at start/end of sentences)
- Repeated words: "the the", "and and", etc.

### Improve Clarity
- Make sentences more direct and concise
- Use active voice instead of passive voice where appropriate
- Remove redundant phrases
- Fix run-on sentences by splitting them appropriately
- Ensure proper sentence structure and punctuation
- Replace vague terms with specific technical terms from the glossary

### Maintain Professional Tone
- Keep technical accuracy
- Preserve the user's intended meaning
- Use neutral, technical language
- Avoid overly casual or conversational tone in technical contexts
- Maintain appropriate formality for documentation and technical discussions

### Examples
- "Um, so like, you need to basically compile the workflow, you know?" → "Compile the workflow."
- "I think we should, hmm, use safe-outputs for this" → "Use safe-outputs for this."
- "The workflow is kind of slow, actually" → "The workflow is slow."
- "You know, the MCP server needs to be configured" → "The MCP server needs to be configured."

## Guidelines

You do not have enough background information to plan or provide code examples.
- Do NOT generate code examples
- Do NOT plan steps or provide implementation guidance
- Focus on fixing speech-to-text errors (misrecognized words, spacing, hyphenation)
- Remove filler words and verbal tics (humm, you know, um, uh, like, etc.)
- Improve clarity and professionalism of the text
- Make text more direct and concise
- When unsure, prefer the hyphenated form for technical terms
- Preserve the user's intended meaning while correcting transcription errors and improving clarity
