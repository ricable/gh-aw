## Go Code Constants

Key constants defined in `pkg/constants/`:

```go
// Job Names
const AgentJobName JobName = "agent"
const ActivationJobName JobName = "activation"
const PreActivationJobName JobName = "pre_activation"
const DetectionJobName JobName = "detection"

// Artifact Names
const SafeOutputArtifactName = "safe-output"
const AgentOutputArtifactName = "agent-output"

// Step IDs
const CheckMembershipStepID StepID = "check_membership"
const CheckStopTimeStepID StepID = "check_stop_time"
const CheckSkipIfMatchStepID StepID = "check_skip_if_match"
const CheckSkipIfNoMatchStepID StepID = "check_skip_if_no_match"

```

## JavaScript Path Patterns

Common path patterns in JavaScript files (`actions/setup/js/*.cjs`):

```javascript
// Setup action destination
const SetupActionDestination = "/tmp/gh-aw/actions"

// Common imports
const { setupGlobals } = require('/tmp/gh-aw/actions/setup_globals.cjs');
const { main } = require('/opt/gh-aw/actions/assign_issue.cjs');
const addCommentScript = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, "add_comment.cjs"), "utf8");

// Artifact references
const artifactDir = '/tmp/gh-aw/threat-detection/';
const patchPath = 'agent-artifacts/tmp/gh-aw/aw.patch';
```

## Docker Integration

Docker-related actions and patterns:

| Component | Description | Context |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `docker/setup-buildx-action` | Docker Buildx setup | Enables multi-platform builds |
| `docker/login-action` | Docker registry authentication | Logs into container registries |
| `docker/metadata-action` | Docker metadata extraction | Generates tags and labels |
| `docker/build-push-action` | Docker build and push | Builds and publishes container images |

## Usage Guidelines

### Artifact Naming
- Use descriptive hyphenated names (e.g., `agent-output`, `mcp-logs`)
- Separate words with hyphens, not underscores (except legacy patterns)
- Use singular nouns (e.g., `safe-output` not `safe-outputs`)
- Prefix with domain when needed (e.g., `cache-memory-focus-areas`)

### Job Naming
- Use snake_case for job names (e.g., `create_pull_request`, `check_membership`)
- Use descriptive verbs (e.g., `update_`, `check_`, `create_`, `send_`)
- Keep names under 30 characters when possible
- Standard suffixes: `_check`, `_status`, `_memory`

### Step ID Naming
- Use snake_case for step IDs (e.g., `check_actor`, `generate_aw_info`)
- Use descriptive action verbs (e.g., `check_`, `generate_`, `handle_`, `compute_`)
- Keep IDs concise but meaningful
- Standard prefixes: `check_` (validation), `handle_` (error handling), `compute_` (calculation)

### Path References
- Use relative paths from repository root for repo files
- Use absolute paths for `/tmp/gh-aw/` runtime files
- Use `/opt/gh-aw/` for pre-installed scripts
- Always use forward slashes, even on Windows

### Action Pinning
- **Always pin actions to full commit SHA for security** (40-character hex)
- Never use tag references (e.g., `@v3`) in production workflows
- Document the version/tag that corresponds to each SHA in comments
- Update SHAs via `.github/aw/actions-lock.json` configuration

### Environment Variables
- Use `GH_AW_` prefix for gh-aw specific variables
- Use uppercase with underscores (e.g., `AGENT_OUTPUT_TYPES`)
- Reference other job outputs using `${{ needs.job_name.outputs.output_name }}`
- Reference secrets using `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`

### File Organization
- Source workflows: `.github/workflows/*.md`
- Compiled workflows: `.github/workflows/*.lock.yml`
- Configuration: `.github/aw/`
- Runtime: `/tmp/gh-aw/`
- Pre-installed: `/opt/gh-aw/`
- Documentation: `scratchpad/`

## Pattern Analysis

### Most Common Patterns

1. **Setup Action**: Nearly every workflow uses `./actions/setup` as first step
2. **Checkout**: `actions/checkout` is used in 95%+ of workflows
3. **Artifact Upload/Download**: Extensive use of artifact passing between jobs
4. **Environment References**: Heavy use of job outputs via `needs.job.outputs.`
5. **Security**: All external actions pinned to full SHAs

### Workflow Structure Pattern

Typical workflow job sequence:

```
activation → agent → detection → safe_outputs → conclusion
     ↓                    ↓            ↓              ↓
     ↓                    ↓            ↓         (always runs)
(conditional)    (uploads artifacts) (dispatches)
```

### Artifact Flow Pattern

```
agent job → uploads agent-output artifact
         → uploads safe-output artifact

detection job → downloads agent-output
              → analyzes outputs
              → triggers safe_outputs job

safe_outputs → downloads safe-output
             → dispatches handler jobs

conclusion → downloads all artifacts (optional)
           → generates summary
```
