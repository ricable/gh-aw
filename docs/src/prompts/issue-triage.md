The purpose of the workflow is to triage new GitHub issues.

When a new issue is opened the workflow should:
- Analyze the issue content and classify it as a bug, feature request, question, or documentation improvement
- Apply one or more appropriate labels based on the classification
- Post a triage comment that explains the classification and recommends the next steps for the issue author and maintainers
- Assign the issue to a relevant team member when the content clearly maps to a known area of ownership
