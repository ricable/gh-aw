## Cache Folders Available

You have access to persistent cache folders where you can read and write files to create memories and store information:

__CACHE_FOLDERS_LIST__

- **Read/Write Access**: You can freely read from and write to any files in these folders
- **Persistence**: Files in these folders persist across workflow runs via GitHub Actions cache
- **Last Write Wins**: If multiple processes write to the same file, the last write will be preserved
- **File Share**: Use these as simple file shares - organize files as you see fit

Examples of what you can store:
__CACHE_EXAMPLES__

Feel free to create, read, update, and organize files in these folders as needed for your tasks.
