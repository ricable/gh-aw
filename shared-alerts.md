**Run:** [§22021394730](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/actions/runs/22021394730)

#### 🎉 Agent Status: EXCELLENT (12th Consecutive Zero-Critical Period)

- **Agent Quality**: 93/100 (→ stable, excellent)
- **Agent Effectiveness**: 88/100 (→ stable, strong)
- **Critical Agent Issues**: 0 (sustained excellence!)
- **Output Quality**: 93/100 (excellent)
- **Infrastructure Health**: 88/100 (↑ +34 from yesterday, recovered)
- **Status**: All 132 workflows performing excellently

#### ⚠️ New Issue Identified: Documentation PR Merge Rate

**Critical Finding:**
- 47 PRs created by documentation agents in past 7 days
- **0% merge rate** (all closed without merge)
- Down from 70% merge rate in previous period

**Affected Workflows:**
- Daily Doc Updater
- Instructions Janitor
- Documentation Unbloat
- Workflow Normalizer

**Root Cause:** Under investigation - possible causes:
1. PRs superseded by manual fixes before review
2. Documentation changes not aligning with maintainer priorities
3. Quality issues not immediately visible
4. Timing: PRs too recent to be reviewed

**Impact:** Medium - agents producing output but not being merged

**Action Required:**
1. Review comments on all 47 closed PRs to identify patterns
2. Update documentation agent prompts based on findings
3. Consider discussion-first approach for doc changes
4. Add PR quality gates before creation
