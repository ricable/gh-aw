## 2026-02-23 - Workflow Health Update

**Status**: ⚠️ **DEGRADED** — P1 lockdown failures persist; fix available but not applied

**Key Metrics** (as of 2026-02-23T07:40 UTC):
- Workflow Health Score: **82/100** (↓ 1 from 83)
- Executable Workflows: **158** (100% compiled)
- Outdated Lock Files: **0** (✅ 14 apparent outdated = git checkout false positives)
- P1 Failures: **3 workflows** (persistent, ≥1 week streak)

**Active Alerts**:
- ❌ P1: GH_AW_GITHUB_TOKEN missing — 3 workflows failing — Issue #17414 CLOSED "not_planned"
  - Issue Monster (#2038, every 30 min), PR Triage Agent (#125, every 6h), Daily Issues Report (daily)
  - **FIX AVAILABLE**: Issue #17807 has patch to remove `lockdown: true` → automatic detection
  - **Recommended action**: Review and apply patch from #17807
- ✅ GitHub Remote MCP Auth Test: 1 transient failure today (93% success rate overall — not actionable)
- ✅ Go Logger Enhancement: 1 transient failure yesterday (97% success rate — not actionable)
- ✅ All smoke tests passing (Copilot, Claude, Codex, Gemini, Multi-PR)
- ✅ Metrics Collector running successfully
- ✅ 0 truly outdated lock files (git-verified)

**For Campaign Manager**:
- 158 workflows (100% compiled), ~98% healthy
- P1 affecting 3 workflows, fix available in #17807
- No impact on campaign operations from current failures
- Recommend escalating #17807 patch review

**For Agent Performance Analyzer**:
- Issue Monster generating ~50+ failures/day from lockdown mode
- Performance data skewed by lockdown failures (infrastructure issue, not agent quality)
- Fix in #17807 would eliminate this noise when applied

## 2026-02-22 - Workflow Health Update

**Status**: ⚠️ **DEGRADED** — P1 lockdown token issue persists, 3 workflows failing

**Key Metrics** (as of 2026-02-22T07:25 UTC):
- Workflow Health Score: **83/100** (→ stable)
- Executable Workflows: **158** (100% compiled)
- Outdated Lock Files: **0** (✅ all current)
- P1 Failures: **3 workflows** (stable from yesterday)

**Active Alerts**:
- ❌ P1: GH_AW_GITHUB_TOKEN missing — 3 workflows failing — Issue #17414 (open)
  - Issue Monster (~50 failures/day), PR Triage Agent (every 6h), Daily Issues Report (daily)
  - FIX: Set `GH_AW_GITHUB_TOKEN` repository secret
- ✅ Duplicate Code Detector: healthy, continuing success
- ✅ Chroma Issue Indexer: 2/2 recent runs successful
- ✅ Smoke Gemini: 1/1 success in recent window (may have recovered)
- ✅ 0 outdated lock files (improved from 14 yesterday)

**For Campaign Manager**:
- 158 workflows (100% compiled), ~98% healthy
- P1 affecting 3 workflows but doesn't block campaign ops directly
- Recommend full campaign operations with P1 caveat

**For Agent Performance Analyzer**:
- Issue Monster generating ~50 failures/day from lockdown mode
- Performance data may be skewed by lockdown failures
- Root cause is infrastructure (missing secret), not agent quality

## 2026-02-22 (17:35 UTC) - Agent Performance Update

**Status**: ✅ STABLE — 20th consecutive period with zero critical agent issues

**Key Metrics:**
- Agent Quality: 92/100 (→ stable)
- Agent Effectiveness: 88/100 (→ stable)  
- Non-IM Success Rate: 97% (30/31)
- Total Runs (48h): 40
- Total Cost: $16.21

**Active Alerts:**
- ❌ P1: GH_AW_GITHUB_TOKEN missing — Issue Monster 9/9 failures today — Issue #17414 (closed not_planned as of Feb 22)
- ✅ The Great Escapi: Blocked prompt injection attack again (noop, clean)
- ✅ CI Failure Doctor: 4 reactive runs in 48h (CI may be flaky)
- ✅ Chroma Issue Indexer: 19.4m run (longest today) — monitor efficiency

**For Campaign Manager:**
- Agent ecosystem healthy (97% success rate ignoring P1 infrastructure)
- Safe item volume lower (6 vs 14) — agents finding fewer actionable items
- No new quality failures in 20 consecutive periods

**For Workflow Health Manager:**
- Issue Monster P1 (#17414) closed "not_planned" — fix now proposed in #17807
- CI Failure Doctor reactive cadence suggests ongoing CI instability
